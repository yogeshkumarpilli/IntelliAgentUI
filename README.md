# üåå RAG with an Intelligent Agent

Welcome to an exploration of advanced AI capabilities with my Langchain-powered application! This project showcases how Langchain can be used to build sophisticated and interactive AI solutions, designed for clarity and ease of use via a Streamlit interface.

---

## ‚ú® Features at a Glance

* **Dynamic Conversational Flows:** Engage with an AI capable of understanding context and maintaining coherent dialogue.
* **Modular Langchain Architecture:** Built with best practices for scalable and maintainable LLM applications.
* **Intuitive Streamlit UI:** A simple and elegant web interface that makes interacting with the AI a breeze.
* **Robust Docker Deployment on Hugging Face Spaces:** This application is deployed using a **custom Dockerfile** on Hugging Face Spaces, leveraging the **Docker SDK** for full environment control and reproducibility.
* **Optimized with `uv`:** Lightning-fast dependency installation for quick builds and efficient resource use.



## üí° How It Works

This application leverages the **Langchain framework** to orchestrate interactions with large language models. Key components include:

* **Chains & Agents:** Defining the logical steps and decision-making processes for the AI.
* **Integrations:** Connecting to various LLMs and potentially other tools (e.g., search, knowledge bases).
* **Memory:** Enabling the AI to remember past interactions within a session for more natural conversations.

The user interface is built with **Streamlit**, providing an interactive web app where you can input prompts and view AI responses in real-time.

## üõ†Ô∏è Technologies Used

* **Langchain:** The powerful framework for developing applications powered by LLMs.
* **Streamlit:** For creating interactive web applications with pure Python.
* **Python 3.x:** The core programming language.
* **uv:** A blazing-fast Python package installer and resolver.
* **Docker:** Used for containerizing the application. The deployment on Hugging Face Spaces utilizes a **custom `Dockerfile`** and the **Docker SDK**, offering complete control over the runtime environment.
* **Hugging Face Spaces:** For seamless model and app deployment, specifically using its **Docker SDK** for this project.

## üöÄ Deployment on Hugging Face Spaces (Docker SDK)

This project is deployed on Hugging Face Spaces using a custom Docker image. The `Dockerfile` in this repository specifies the exact environment, dependencies, and commands needed to run the Streamlit application. Hugging Face Spaces automatically builds this Docker image and runs the application, ensuring a consistent and reproducible deployment. This approach provides maximum flexibility for complex applications.
